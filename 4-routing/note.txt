Receiving messages selectively

Goal: we're going to make it possible to subscribe only to a subset of the messages. 
For example, we will be able to direct only critical error messages to the log file (to save disk space), while still being able to print all of the log messages on the console.

====================================
Previous: Our logging system from the previous tutorial broadcasts all messages to all consumers. 
Now: Allow filtering messages based on their severity.

====================================
If you'd like to see all the log messages on your screen, open a new terminal and do: `go run receive_logs_direct.go info warning error`
And, for example, to emit an error log message just type: `go run emit_log_direct.go error "Run. Run. Or it will explode."`


To run receiver: `go run main.go info warning error` (If you want to see message type: info, warning, error)
To run sender: `go run main.go error "Run. Run. Or it will explode."`
