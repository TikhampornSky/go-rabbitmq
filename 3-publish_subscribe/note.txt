Sending messages to many consumers at once

- Exchange Types: direct, topic, headers and fanout (we'll focus on the last one)
- fanout = broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the queues it knows

===================================================
- We want to hear about all log messages, not just a subset of them. We're also interested only in currently flowing messages not in the old ones. To solve that we need two things.
1. Whenever we connect to Rabbit we need a fresh, empty queue. To do this we could create a queue with a random name, or, even better - let the server choose a random queue name for us.
2. Once we disconnect the consumer the queue should be automatically deleted.
