Receiving messages based on a pattern (topics) --> "Topic Exchange"

In our logging system we might want to subscribe to not only logs based on severity, but also based on the source which emitted the log. 
You might know this concept from the syslog unix tool, which routes logs based on both severity (info/warn/crit...) and facility (auth/cron/kern...).

The logic behind the topic exchange is similar to a direct one - a message sent with a particular routing key will be delivered to all the queues 
that are bound with a matching binding key. However there are two important special cases for binding keys:
    * (star) can substitute for exactly one word.    - the topic exchange will behave just like a direct one.
    # (hash) can substitute for zero or more words.  - it will receive all the messages, regardless of the routing key - like in fanout exchange.
